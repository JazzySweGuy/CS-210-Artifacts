# CS-210-Artifacts

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
* This project was about reading from a grocery list and being able to pull frequency data from it. Options ranged from seeing the frequency of one item to all items to all items in a histogram.
# What did you do particularly well?
* I would say I did a good job of seperating the code into the proper chunks and making them all work in unison. I did my best to put the least amount of code in Main.
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
* I feel there are definitly ways to make my code more efficient but those techniques are above me for right now. I could have incorporated pointers for example or a linked list
# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
* The most chaleenging definitly was the methods. C++ does not have the best error notification system so I struggled for a while, all to realize I was adding the h file to the wrong cpp file.
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
* I would say thought process is always transferable to other projects. I was able to see how I would make my code in my head before I wrote it. This helps me in all projects because after that its just about getting the syntax right.
# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
* I did this by making clean code meaning proper namimg conventions, camelCase variable naming, proper spacing and testing often.
